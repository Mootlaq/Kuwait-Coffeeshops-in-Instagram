There are several reasons to use English instead of the first language in the country you operate in. I believe this README is better written in English instead of Arabic, for example. But is that still the case in the context of Coffeeshops? If you own a coffeeshop in Kuwait, which language would you use in your marketing (Instagram here)?

In this project, I investigate the use of languages in 17 Kuwaiti coffeeashops. Do Kuwaiti coffeeshops use English more than Arabic in their posts? What about their clients (followers)? Do they use Arabic or English? Now would it make sense to use the same language of your clients? I talk about all that in [this Article](https://caramel.la/home/GlA01Qwnp/alinjlyzy-akshkh-wla-alarby-ablgh). 

I used in Instagram-Scrapper library to scrape the data from Instagram accounts which returns a JSON file that I used to reconstruct as a dataframe for each coffeeshop. Then using Google Translate API, I detected the language of each post and comment. Then, I used my functions to create a dataframe that includes the data for all coffeeshops.

This repo includes two notebooks I used for my analysis. It also includes CSV files of three coffeeshops as examples and a JSON file to give an idea of the the data scraped from Instagram. Lastly, the table that shows the percentage of Arabic posts and comments in each coffeeshop is included too.
